      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The real reason why Agile/Scrum teams meet daily in a Daily Standup is to uncover problems. If the team is not conducting the Daily Standup, problems will remain unidentified, negatively impacting project delivery. Daily Standup is a 15-minute time-boxed event where team members discuss what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and anything blocking their progress. Discussing technical solutions should happen outside the standup.",
